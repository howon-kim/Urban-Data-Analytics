the city center of Union City, covering an area of 0.71 square miles. The specific data will also be developed

### Variables and Finding
This report is based on ACS (American Community Survey) and LEHD (Longitudinal Employer–Household
Dynamics) data from 2010 and 2018. The data we are focusing on this portfolio is the population/household
structure, racial/ethnic composition, income and poverty levels, and labor force characteristics. Our main goal
is to explore the impact of income changes on different ethnic groups.

## Covid-19’s Effects on Bike Sharing in San Francisco
#### Co-Author : Azucena Castro, FengChi Juan, Ho Won Kim
### Description
The Bay Area’s bike share pilot program was established in August 2013 as Bay Area Bike Share with only a few bikes
and stations in operation. The program was later re-launched as Ford GoBike in 2017 and expanded to multiple cities
in the Bay Area with over 2,600 bikes. Recently, in June 2019 the bike share program was rebranded to Bay Wheels.
Bay Wheels currently operates in San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley, and San Jose. As of June 2020, Bay Wheels had
over 200 bike stations located throughout San Francisco.
Due to the recent coronavirus pandemic, a shelter-in-place order went into effect in San Francisco on March 19th in
order to allow social distancing and prevent the spread of the virus. The following report explores the change over time
in bike sharing patterns for San Francisco from January 2018 through May 2020. We hope to find changes in bike
share usage, travel patterns, and travel locations that occurred after and during the shelter-in-place dates.
